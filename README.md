###### Founder/CEO of [Lexrunit Limited](https://www.lexrunit.com), CEO of [Nilphyx](https://www.nilphyx.tech), and Web/IT Director at [Free Future Foundation](https://www.freefuturefoundation.org)

##### My core interest is in AGI and I strive to ensure African inclusion in the AI revolution.

This is still the beginning of my journey. <br>
What sets me aside is my readiness to learn, experiment and to solve problems.

I am open to work on interesting projects, I would love to learn, grow and experiment. You can check out my portfolio [here](https://buchi.codes)
